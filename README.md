# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information on electric vehicles (EVs). The analysis aims to explore various aspects of the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights into trends in the electric vehicle market.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on various electric vehicles, with columns such as:
- VIN (1-10)
- County
- City
- State
- Postal Code
- Model Year
- Make
- Model

- Electric Utility
- 2020 Census Tract

## Tasks Completed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover insights from the dataset.

2. **Choropleth Visualization**:
   - Created a choropleth map using `plotly.express` to display the number of EV vehicles based on location.

3. **Racing Bar Plot Animation**:
   - Developed a racing bar plot to animate the counts of different electric vehicle makes over the years.
